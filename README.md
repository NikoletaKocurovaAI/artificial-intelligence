# ðŸ‘‹ Dear IT Enthusiast, Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## ðŸš€ About Me

I have turned my job into a hobby! Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer 
on an AI team, leveraging my experience in data science. Beyond my professional work, I'm also a hobbyist who 
enjoys diving into robotics projects.

You can learn more about my professional background and view my CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikoleta-kocurova-295a5011b/).

I also work on an educational project where I create videos on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thegirlinitwonderland/) 
about robotics that is understandable for everyone.

## ðŸ’¼ My Projects

Feel free to explore my artificial-intelligence repository, which is project focusing on AI and Robotics. It includes 
the following topics:

### Generative AI project

This project focuses on several key aspects:

- **Web Development**: How to build a back-end web application using the MVC pattern and the FastAPI.
- **3-rd Party API Integration**: Integrating external APIs such as the WeatherAPI and OpenAI API.
- **Application Dockerization**: How to containerize the web application using Docker and push an image to GHCR.
- **CI CD pipeline**: How to use the GitHub Actions, including steps for static analysis, automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: How to deploy the app to GCP GKE using ClusterIP.

```

### Object detection and classification research

This research focuses on several key aspects:

- **Data Collection**: How to use the MS COCO API to gather dataset essential for training classification 
model.
- **Object Detection**: How to use OpenCV library and YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection within images.
- **Object Classification**: Involves training a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify objects based on 
the collected data.

```

### Data Preparation

Extracts metadata from the downloaded annotation file, which is used to download images via the MS COCO API.

```

### Frontend App

It is a Django project designed to help understand the framework. It utilizes the MVT (Model-View-Template) architectural 
pattern and Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). The project includes the implementation of endpoints, forms, and 
various tests, including unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

```

### Robot

This component of the project includes scripts designed to be executed on a Raspberry Pi 3. These scripts enable the 
functionality and control of the differential wheeled robot which is equipped with computer vision capabilities for object 
detection and classification.
